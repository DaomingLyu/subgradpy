SubgradPy
=========

SubgradPy is a prototype package for analyzing symbolic expressions and evaluating subgradients at given points. This package is no longer maintained, and the feature is supported by [CVXPY](http://www.cvxpy.org/), a domain-specific language for convex optimization embedded in Python.
